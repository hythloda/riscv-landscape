              The AIRISC family of RISC-V cores developed by Fraunhofer IMS enables efficient machine learning and AI in sensors, IoT devices, and other
              embedded applications. AIRISC variants with extended safety mechanisms such as dual-core lock-stepping (DCLS) or error correcting codes (ECC) are
              available for use in fail-safe systems according to ISO 26262 (up to ASIL-D) and DIN 61508.


              The AIRISC Core Complex is based on a 32-bit RISC-V CPU compatible to the RISC-V unprivileged and privileged specifications also supporting the
              RISC-V External Debug specification. The CPU implements a Harvard architecture with a four-level pipeline and separate AHB-Lite interfaces for
              instruction fetch and data access. The core's RV32I_Zicsr base ISA can be further extended via a unified co-processor interface (PCPI).

            description: >-
              High-performance RISC-V processors and accelerators have been announced, but RISC-V- based HPC systems will need a holistic co-design effort,
              spanning memory, storage hierarchy interconnects and full software stack. Monte Cimone is a fully-operational multi-blade computer prototype and
              hardware-software test-bed based on U740, a double-precision capable multi-core, 64-bit RISC-V SoC.

            description: >-
              Implementing security functions require high-level abstractions of the hardware, typically provided by an Operating System (OS). Because the
              correctness of the security functions depends on the correctness of these high-level abstractions, the OS that implements them should be free from
              exploitable vulnerabilities.


              The secure OS needs to be of the highest software quality possible and be as close as possible to zero defect. To meet that goal, the only
              available strategy to date is to develop the OS using deductive formal methods.


              This is why ProvenRun has developed ProvenCore, an formally proven ultra secure OS/TEE. It is a key milestone for being able to develop
              secure-by-design connected devices in many sectors (automotive, railways, aeronautics, energy, industrial, medical, etc.), in a cost effective
              way.

              The PX5 RTOS features a native implementation of the industry standard POSIX pthreads API as well as best-of-class size and performance. As for
              safety and security, the PX5 RTOS provides Pointer/Data Verification (PDV) technology, which developers can leverage at run-time to verify
              function return addresses, function pointers, system objects, global data, and memory pools. This technology is unique to the PX5 RTOS. In
              addition to the native POSIX pthread support (semaphore, mutex, message queue, etc.), the PX5 RTOS also offers real-time extensions such as event
              flags, fast queues, tick timers, memory management, and more. Given the PX5 RTOS industry-standard POSIX pthreads API support, a wide range of
              software stacks are instantly enabled – both open source and commercial – for real-time embedded IoT platforms.

              through virtualization, allowing different applications to share the same hardware platform through the isolation in time and space of these
              applications in partitions (TSP). Thanks to XtratuM, developers can build bare-metal applications or use different operating systems over the same
              platform, as well as to allocate applications with different criticality levels to each partition. The use of XtratuM is convenient for systems in
              which the main challenges deal with safety, the reuse of certified applications, dynamic software updates and size, weight, power and cost
              reduction of embedded safety-critical systems.

              Valtrix Systems - an EDA company from Bangalore, India, is into the development of CPU and SoC design verification tools. STING, the flagship
              product of Valtrix, is a commercially supported design verification tool for RISC-V used by several CPU and SoC vendors for ensuring functional
              correctness and architectural compliance. The tool can be configured to generate portable bare-metal programs containing self-checking
              architecturally-correct test stimulus, which can then be enabled on simulation, FPGA prototypes, emulation or silicon.
